## JTempest Features and Tips
 
JTempest is a faithful recreation of the original Tempest game, with some minor differences. Here are some of the features and tips you should know about JTempest:

- JTempest has three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard. You can choose the level before starting the game or change it during the game by pressing the F1, F2, or F3 keys.
- JTempest has 99 levels, each with a different shape and color. You can start from any level you want by pressing the number keys from 0 to 9. You can also skip levels by pressing the space bar.
- JTempest has two modes: normal and warp. In normal mode, you move your shooter along the edge of the surface and shoot enemies that come from the center. In warp mode, you move your shooter in a circular motion around the surface and shoot enemies that come from the sides. You can switch between modes by pressing the W key.
- JTempest has four types of enemies: flippers, tankers, spikers, and pulsars. Flippers are the most common enemies that flip along the surface and try to reach your shooter. Tankers are large enemies that split into two flippers when shot. Spikers are enemies that create spikes on the surface that can kill your shooter if you touch them. Pulsars are enemies that emit electric pulses that can stun your shooter if you are on the same segment.
- JTempest has two power-ups: superzapper and jump. Superzapper is a weapon that kills all enemies on the screen once per level. You can activate it by pressing the Z key. Jump is a skill that allows your shooter to jump over spikes or enemies. You can activate it by pressing the J key.
